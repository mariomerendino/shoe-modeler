# Todos

1. Possibly Refactor the Model component, make the model component render multiple "mesh" components.
2. Fix the onClick Issue. Sometimes when clicking a piece of the 3d model, the onclick event registers a different model.
3. Fix changing the color of a non white mesh. When mesh is not white, it seems like it "blends" the colors of the model. Weird....
